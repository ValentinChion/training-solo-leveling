# Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint - Progression System Reference

## Overview
The Star Stream is a system where human struggles called "Scenarios" are broadcast to a celestial audience. Intermediaries called **Dokkaebis** act as GMs/show hosts managing the scenarios.

---

## Incarnations (Players)
Incarnations are human participants in scenarios. They start with no status, no stories, and no coins.

### Stats
4 core stats, each rated by level (starting range 1-10, combined total >25 is impressive):
- **Strength (STR)**
- **Agility (AGI)**
- **Constitution (CON)**
- **Magic Power (MAG)**

Stats can be raised through coin payments. Cost increases every 10 levels.

### Attribute Grades (ascending rarity)
1. **General**
2. **Rare**
3. **Hero**
4. **Legend / Legendary**
5. **Quasi-myth**
6. **Myth**

Attributes can undergo **attribute evolution** when used frequently in suitable situations, gaining higher ratings and potentially unlocking additional skills.

### Skill Levels
- Skills are rated through levels; higher level = stronger skill
- Most starting skills range from level 1 to 10

---

## Scenarios
- **Main Scenarios** — Numbered progression (Main Scenario 1, 2, 3...)
- **Sub Scenarios** — Side challenges
- Completing scenarios earns **coins** and **Stories**
- Scenarios are broadcast to constellations via Star Stream channels

---

## Constellations
Extremely powerful beings immortalized in humanity's history — mythic heroes, great sages, mythological creatures, spirits, ancient gods. Some humans become constellations upon death due to the fame of their stories.

### Constellation Grades (ascending)
1. **Historical-grade** (lowest)
2. **Narrative-grade** (middle)
3. **Myth-grade** (highest) — rarely interfere with lower-ranked scenarios

### Ascension
Incarnations become constellations upon acquiring **5 Legendary-grade Stories minimum**. The Star Stream grants them a modifier reflecting their narrative identity.

### Coin Economy for Constellations
- Passively earn coins from their fame
- Coins deplete constantly (cost of maintaining their modifier/existence)
- Indirect messaging costs 200 coins per message
- VIP members get messaging exemptions
- Financial pressure incentivizes continuous coin generation

---

## Sponsor Contracts
When a constellation favors an incarnation, they form a **sponsor contract**:
- Constellation transmits personal **stigmas** to the incarnation
- Provides coin sponsorship (minimum thresholds per channel)
- Grants growth packages via the **Dokkaebi Bag**
- Takes responsibility for sponsored incarnation's actions

### Stream Contracts
Between constellations and dokkaebis — the dokkaebi features the incarnation in exchange for commission-based coin sharing.

---

## Stigmas
Special abilities passed from constellation sponsors to incarnations.

### Key Properties
- Unique skills intrinsically linked to their creator's personality/nature
- Cannot be shared by multiple incarnations/constellations unless through sponsor contract or direct gift
- Formed by certain individuals based on their nature

### Acquisition Methods
1. **Trial-based** — Constellations give trials that reward fables or stigmas
2. **Sponsorship incentive** — Gifted to persuade incarnations into sponsorship
3. **Pure will** — Granted without formal trials in some cases

---

## Stories
- Collected through impressive scenario performances
- Graded using the same scale: General → Rare → Hero → Legend → Quasi-myth → Myth
- 5 Legendary+ Stories = ascend to Constellation status
- Constellations can "eat" stories and interpret them

---

## Coin Economy Summary
- **Earned by:** completing scenarios, constellation sponsorship, fame (for constellations)
- **Spent on:** stat upgrades (cost scales every 10 levels), items from Dokkaebi Bag, messaging, maintaining constellation status
- **Dokkaebi Bag:** shop system where growth packages and items are sold

---

## Fitness Tracker Mapping
- **STR** = Weights / strength training
- **AGI** = Running / HIIT
- **CON** = Endurance activities
- **MAG** = Yoga / recovery / flexibility
- **Scenarios** = Workout challenges
- **Constellations** = Long-term achievement milestones
- **Coins** = Earned from workouts, spent on upgrades; gentle decay (3-day grace, -1/week, floor at 1)
- **Dokkaebi Bag** = In-app shop for stat boosts and rewards
